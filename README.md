# wifcrack

This repository provides a small C module derived from a Java class used in a Bitcoin related project. The `configuration.h` and `configuration.c` files implement a `Configuration` structure and helper functions for managing solver configuration data.

The project expects example data from the original [WifSolver](https://github.com/PawelGorny/WifSolver) repository. Because this environment does not have network access, the `examples` directory contains only a placeholder README. Copy the files from `WifSolver/examples` manually if you need them.
